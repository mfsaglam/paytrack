## Core Functionality (v1.0)

- **Create and Track Items**: Users can easily create new items in the app to represent their various financial obligations, such as monthly bills, loan payments, or installment plans.

- **Manage Installments**: Paytrack enables users to monitor their installments effectively. They can input payment details, including due dates and amounts, for each item in the list.

- **Automatic Status Updates**: The system automatically updates the status of items based on payment dates. Once a payment date has passed, Paytrack deducts the corresponding installment from the total amount owed.

- **Streamlined Interface**: Paytrack provides a clear and organized list of items, making it simple for users to visualize their financial commitments at a glance.

- **Automatic Removal of Completed Items**: When all payments for an item have been completed, Paytrack removes it from the list, helping users stay organized and focused on their outstanding obligations.

- **Total Installment Amount**: Users can conveniently view the total amount of installments remaining at the top of the list, providing a quick overview of their financial responsibilities.

With Paytrack, managing monthly payments and installments has never been easier. Stay organized, stay on track, and take control of your finances with Paytrack.
