## Core Functionality (v1.0)

- **Create and Track Items**: Users can easily create new items in the app to represent their various financial obligations, such as monthly bills, loan payments, or installment plans.

- **Manage Installments**: Installment Tool enables users to monitor their installments effectively. They can input payment details, including due dates and amounts, for each item in the list.

- **Automatic Status Updates**: The system automatically updates the status of items based on payment dates. Once a payment date has passed, Paytrack deducts the corresponding installment from the total amount owed.

- **Streamlined Interface**: Installment Tool provides a clear and organized list of items, making it simple for users to visualize their financial commitments at a glance.

- **Automatic Removal of Completed Items**: When all payments for an item have been completed, Paytrack removes it from the list, helping users stay organized and focused on their outstanding obligations.

- **Total Installment Amount**: Users can conveniently view the total amount of installments remaining at the top of the list, providing a quick overview of their financial responsibilities.

With Installment Tool, managing monthly payments and installments has never been easier. Stay organized, stay on track, and take control of your finances with Installment Tool.
